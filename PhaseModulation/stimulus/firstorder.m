function [freqs, gain] = firstorder(A, lofreq, hifreq, freqint)% FIRSTORDER - returns the complex gain of a first order lowpass system with% parameter A radians^-1 over the frequency range% [lofreq: freqint: hifreq]. It is the user's responsibility to make sure% the units are consistent, but the routine assumes that frequencies are% specified in radians.%   [freqs, gain] = firstorder(A, lofr, hifr, freqint)% Transfer function is 1/(jwA+1), so the cutoff frequency is 1/A rad.freqs = [lofreq:freqint:hifreq]';gain = zeros(length(freqs),1);for j1=1:length(freqs)   gain(j1) = 1/(j*freqs(j1)*A+1);endreturn
