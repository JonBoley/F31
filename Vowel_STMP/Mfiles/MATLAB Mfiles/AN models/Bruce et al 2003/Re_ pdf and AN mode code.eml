Hi Mike,

I now have a version of my auditory-periphery model ready for public
distribution.  You can get the code from
http://www.ece.mcmaster.ca/~ibruce/deafcat2newme/deafcat2newme.htm

Let me know if you have any questions, particularly if you need details of
the new version of the middle-ear filter that I'm using.

Ian
