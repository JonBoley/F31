Hi Mike,

Likewise.

Thanks for the PDFs.  I had looked through your J. Neurophys. paper briefly
on-line but hadn't downloaded the PDF yet.

Re. the model code, is the undergrad going to be compiling it under Windows
or Unix?  I currently have a Unix version for public distribution, but I'm
still working on a Windows version.  The problem is that the rand() function
does not give enough precision if spikes are being generated at a sampling
frequency of 500 kHz, so I use the drand48() function that is available with
most Unix compilers.  I have the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL) installed on
my Windows machine, which provides an equivalent to drand48() for Windows
compilers.  However, I haven't had a chance yet to work out how to best
include the GSL .h and .lib files into the public distribution (so that
users don't have to install the complete GSL) and instruct users how to
modify their Matlab MEX setup to include the GSL files.  I'm trying to make
time to do this over the couple of weeks, so I'll let you know when I've got
it ready.

Shall do.  And the same to Karen and Jonathan

Cheers,

Hi Ian,

It was great to see you at ARO and to catch up.  I wanted to send you a pdf
of our recent J Neurophysiol paper on the slopes of RLFs.  While I'm at it,
I'll also attach a copy of our paper from the ISH meeting in France last
summer; the book is coming out this spring.  Hopefully there will be a few
more papers soon from my ARO poster that will more directly address
recruitment and JNDs.

I also wanted to ask you for the source code from your version of the AN
model.  We have an undergrad here who is going to use the model this
semester to develop some ways to separate and quantify the strengths of
compression and suppression in our normal and impaired data.  He has the
compiled mex code from your model, but he wants to do things similar to what
I did in my auditory-filter JASA paper (e.g.,compare different versions of
the model, e.g, broad/narrow-band control path, etc ... to separate
compression and suppression), and to do so he needs to be able to modify the
source code.  Also, he is interested in looking at revcors and things that
need individual spike trains, for which it would be helpful to be able to
save "sout" after running the model once, and then only have to run the
spike-generation model multiple times to get individual spike trains rather
than the PST, which I guess from what he's told me is what the model
currently gives you as output.  Anyway, for several reasons, it would help
him a lot for his project to be able to modify the source code to be able to
use the model in a more flexible way.

Please give my best to Gillian, Owen, and Colin

Thanks and best wishes,

Mike
